# NightSpot: A Forum App

Forums are public messaging boards that people can use to communicate with each other about a variety of different topics. It is an online platform to discuss topics or ask questions using asynchronous communication. It allows users to hold discussions, as well as respond to existing discussions by sharing their ideas, opinions, and advice. It is a medium where ideas and views on particular issues can be freely expressed. 

**NightSpot** is a project aimed to fulfill the following problem: A need to have a platform for questions and answers, as well as socializing and a field for discussion inside online communities for social circulation and discourse of information. In this platform, we are able to build communities with mutual interest and share our lives with the rest of the world.

After a rigid planning, analysis and design, we initiated the development of the application and the implementation of the features. NightSpot implemented the standard features of a simple forum application.
